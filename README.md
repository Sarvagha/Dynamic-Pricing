# Dynamic-Pricing
Dynamic Pricing is an application that involves adjusting product or service prices based on various factors in real time. It is employed by businesses to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, customer behaviour, and competitor pricing. Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

### Problem Statement

A ride-sharing company wants to implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize fares based on real-time market conditions. The company only uses ride duration to decide ride fares currently. The company aims to leverage data-driven techniques to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that can dynamically adjust prices in response to changing factors.

### Goal

Our goal is to build a dynamic pricing model that incorporates the provided features to predict optimal fares for rides in real-time. The model must consider factors such as demand patterns and supply availability.

### Dataset 

A dataset containing historical ride data has been provided. The dataset includes features such as the number of riders, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status, number of past rides, average ratings, time of booking, vehicle type, expected ride duration, and historical cost of the rides.

### Stratergy

Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.

### Summary
In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.
